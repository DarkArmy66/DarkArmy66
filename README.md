### 👋 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about **network reconnaissance**, **Bash/Python scripting**, and **search algorithms** that bridge the gap between **AI/ML** and **penetration testing**.

🎓 My academic journey began in **Psychology and Cognitive Science**, and I’m now certified through **HTB** and **EC-Council** — building my path into red teaming and applied offensive security.

💡 I'm especially interested in how we can develop smarter, **AI-powered recon tools** and learning systems that help us navigate complex digital attack surfaces.
